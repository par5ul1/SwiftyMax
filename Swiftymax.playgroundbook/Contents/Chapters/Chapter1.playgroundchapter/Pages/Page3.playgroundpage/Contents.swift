 # Some Final Words
 
 Thank you so much for going through this PlaygroundBook. Everything you see here has been made by me in 5 days all while balancing school life and family. I had practically no programming experience with Swift (though I was familiar with concepts such as views, optionals, etc.) and I learnt so much in this short time period. I had coding experience with JavaScript, MATLAB and Python before so I wasn't completely in the dark but this still proved to be a challenge and a very intriguing one at that. I went through a lot of Documentation as well as a ton on Open-Source projects to produce this.
 
 I really hope you enjoyed it and that you learnt something in the process. Unfortunately, I have to make this project 3 minutes long otherwise I would have gone a bit more in [depth](glossary://depth) (pun intended) on this topic.
 
 Anyways, thanks again.
